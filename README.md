# MakeIntersectionsSafer

**URL:** https://arslansajid527.wixsite.com/proj39542

**Theme:** Safety, Collisions, Social Justice

**Abstract:** I'm focused on identifying the intersection with a high volume of crashes and trying to find a solution with car features. Data science helps my approach because raw data is available, neat and clean, and can be manipulated to show a wide range of things like pinpoint intersections for me or even do simple math (ex: mean, avg, etc.).

**Relevance to NYC:** The data being used is from NYC OpenData
